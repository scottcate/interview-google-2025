Fifteen years at Google has been an incredible journey. I've witnessed firsthand how a culture of psychological safety can transform teams, spark innovation, and fuel personal growth.

As the old adage goes, "people don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care." The wisdom in these words lies in their recognition that trust is an emotional bond, forged when one person feels seen, heard, and valued by another.

My own leader, Rob Birdsong, often emphasizes that "an individual's experience at Google is profoundly shaped by the culture their direct manager cultivates. By prioritizing psychological safety, we as managers have the power to transform the overall experience for everyone on our teams."

Psychological safety, simply put, is the belief that you won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up, sharing ideas, asking questions, or making mistakes. It's the foundation for a workplace where people feel empowered to take risks, challenge the status quo, and bring their whole selves to work.

At Google, I've seen this play out in countless ways. Two particular moments stick out in memory.

## Early Lesson: The Watermelon Deal

One of my earliest lessons in psychological safety came during my first year at Google. I was a new Sales Engineer, eager to prove myself, and was assigned to an account with a crucial deal on the line for the quarter. The more I dug into the details, the more I realized it was what I've recently heard described as a "watermelon" deal â€” green on the outside, but deep red on the inside. I was convinced it wasn't going to close.

Being new to the team, I was very hesitant to voice my concerns. What if I was wrong and people thought I was incompetent? Or worse, that I'm just rocking the boat? But, I had a great manager, and I decided to trust that budding relationship. I carefully, but directly, pointed out the significant challenges we faced in closing the deal.

His response was textbook Google. "Thank you for bringing this up," he said. "That's valuable perspective, and it was a blind spot for me. Let's discuss what we can do to get things back on track."

That moment was a pivotal learning experience for me as a young Googler. It taught me that it was not only okay, but encouraged, to challenge the status quo and not fear the outcome.

## Learning from Failure: The Resource Allocation Decision

The second instance, which occurred years later, highlighted the power of psychological safety in action during a challenging situation involving the allocation of scarce, high-value resources. The team tasked with making the decision was under immense pressure, and they genuinely strived to make the best call possible.

The individual leading the team ultimately made the final decision. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the wrong one, costing the company significantly, both in direct costs and missed opportunities.

I braced myself for the fallout, expecting the person who made the call to face harsh repercussions. But our leadership team responded in a remarkable way. The VP, who was ultimately accountable for the miss, simply asked two questions: "Did you do the best job you could have knowing what you did at the time? And how can we improve our processes to ensure we have better data next time?" There was no blame, only a shared desire to learn and improve.

In a private conversation later, I asked the VP how he planned to account for the financial impact of the decision. He smiled and said, "Personally, I'm going to consider it an investment in employee training and focus on how we move forward from here."

This blameless post-mortem approach is central to the concept of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at Google, and thankfully it's permeated the broader company culture. I'm so grateful it has.

## Key Takeaways

These experiences, and many others, have taught me that psychological safety isn't just a buzzword; it's a critical ingredient for building high-performing teams and a thriving workplace culture. It's about creating an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and heard.

Here are a few key takeaways from my time at Google:

- **Leaders set the tone.** When leaders model vulnerability, encourage open communication, and actively listen to their teams, they create a ripple effect that fosters psychological safety throughout the organization.

- **It's about building trust.** Psychological safety doesn't happen overnight; it's built on a foundation of trust, respect, and mutual support.

- **Mistakes are opportunities for learning.** A culture of psychological safety embraces mistakes as valuable learning opportunities, rather than something to be feared.

- **Diverse perspectives are essential.** When people feel safe to share their unique perspectives and experiences, it leads to richer discussions, better decision-making, and more innovative solutions.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to have learned so much about psychological safety during my time here at Google. It's a lesson I'll carry with me throughout my career, and one I believe is essential for any organization that wants to thrive in today's rapidly changing world.

What's your take? While we truly strive to embrace the idea of psychological safety at Google, it's a universal concept employed by most high-performing teams. Have you ever felt empowered to speak up or challenge an idea? How did it go? Share your story and inspire others!
