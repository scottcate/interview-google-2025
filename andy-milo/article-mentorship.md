We often hear about the importance of mentorship and sponsorship in career development, but what do they really mean, and why do you need both?

- **Mentorship** offers guidance, support, and advice. A mentor shares their experience, helps you navigate challenges, and provides a sounding board for your ideas. They're your trusted advisor, invested in your growth.

- **Sponsorship** takes it a step further. A sponsor actively advocates for you, opening doors to opportunities you might not see. They put their reputation on the line, vouching for your potential and helping you climb the ladder.

Think of it this way: a mentor helps you develop the skills to succeed, while a sponsor puts you in the position to use those skills. Both relationships are invaluable, each contributing to your career in a unique way.

Personally, I've seen the power of both mentorship and sponsorship firsthand.

Early in my career, a sponsor unexpectedly opened a door for me to transition from IT to Technical Sales. I hadn't even considered the move, but they recognized my potential and advocated for me, even though it didn't directly benefit them. Their belief in me and their willingness to leverage their influence changed the trajectory of my career, and I'll forever be grateful for their sponsorship.

My journey also highlights the profound impact of peer sponsorship. A former colleague generously advocated for me, securing my first opportunity at Google. Without their belief and initiative, I likely wouldn't have even considered applying, let alone navigated the competitive hiring process. This act of sponsorship not only opened a door but ignited a passion that has shaped my career ever since.

On the mentorship side, guiding talented individuals has been a true privilege. Early on, I focused primarily on offering advice and support, unaware of the broader concept of sponsorship. Discovering this distinction was transformative. It ignited a passion for actively advocating for my mentees, opening doors, and creating opportunities for their advancement. This shift, while simple for me, has ensured that those deserving of every opportunity have a true champion in their corner, maximizing their chances of success.

**Calling all leaders and managers:** Mentorship is crucial, but let's challenge ourselves to move beyond guidance and into active sponsorship. Identify those high-potential individuals in your teams and actively champion their growth. Put them forward for stretch assignments, introduce them to key decision-makers, and publicly recognize their achievements. By sponsoring talent, we create a culture of growth and empower the next generation of leaders.

**Individual Contributors:** Seek out both mentors and sponsors. Find individuals in leadership who believe in your potential and are willing to invest in your success. Remember, a strong network is key to unlocking your full potential. Also, don't overlook your ability to mentor and sponsor individuals as well. A peer sponsor was absolutely critical in my career and I'm sure that each of you can play that role for others as well.
