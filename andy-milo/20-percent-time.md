The legendary "20% time" policy at Google, where employees supposedly dedicate a fifth of their workweek to passion projects, has long been the envy of companies worldwide. But the reality of innovation at Google is far more dynamic and inclusive.

While 20% time did play a role in Google's early successes, it's not the whole story. Our approach to innovation is less about a single policy and more about a mindset that permeates the entire organization:

**Innovation is Everyone's Job:** At Google, innovation isn't confined to a select few or a designated time slot. We believe that "Innovation is the job of everybody, all the time, every day." It's a continuous process where everyone, from engineers to business teams, is encouraged and expected to contribute ideas and improvements. We recognize that valuable insights can come from unexpected sources, and foster a culture where everyone feels empowered to share their thoughts and contribute to the innovation process.

**Small Teams, Big Impact:** Google recognizes that the best solutions often come from those closest to the problem. That's why we empower small, focused teams to take ownership of projects and drive them forward. This structure fosters faster decision-making, increased agility, and, most importantly, a deep understanding of the challenges at hand. These tightly-knit teams, armed with intimate knowledge of the issues, are uniquely positioned to develop innovative, effective, and lasting solutions.

**Fail Fast, Learn Faster:** Google embraces a culture of experimentation and rapid iteration. The goal is to test ideas quickly, gather data, and learn from both successes and failures. This approach encourages risk-taking and helps identify promising ideas early on. The Marshmallow Challenge - a team-building exercise where groups build structures out of spaghetti and marshmallows - highlights this perfectly. Kindergartners often outperform adults because they instinctively iterate and experiment, building and rebuilding until they succeed. Google applies this same principle to innovation, emphasizing action and learning over rigid planning. It turns out, the best way to have a great idea, is to have a lot of ideas!

**Think 10x, Not 10%:** Google doesn't aim for incremental improvements. The focus, somewhat famous at this point, is on "10x thinking" - setting audacious goals that push the boundaries of what's possible. Early in my career at Google I remember hearing Astro Teller, say that "Our ambitions are a glass ceiling on what is possible." It left a lasting impression that still guides me to this day. Astro also emphasized this point by stating, "If you want to create a car that gets 10 percent better mileage, you just have to tweak the current design, but if you want to get one that gets five hundred miles per gallon, you need to start over." This mindset fosters breakthrough innovations that can truly change the game.

**The User is Everything:** Google's innovation strategy revolves around deeply understanding user needs and desires. By focusing on solving real problems for real people, the company ensures that its products and services deliver genuine value. In essence, Google embraces the practical side of design, recognizing that "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." This focus on functionality resonates with the core principle of Google's SRE philosophy: ensuring the "job gets done" for the user, reliably and efficiently.

The key takeaway? Google's innovation success isn't about a magic formula or a single policy. It's about fostering a culture where everyone feels empowered to contribute, where experimentation is encouraged, and where the user is always at the center of the equation. It's a model that any company, regardless of size or industry, can learn from and adapt to fuel its own innovation journey.
