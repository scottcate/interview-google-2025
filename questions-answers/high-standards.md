## Interview Questions

### 1. Tell me about a time you have been unsatisfied with the status quo. What did you do to change it? Were you successful?

**S:** Video Posters being hard coded in English

### 2. Tell me about a time you wouldn't compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough. What was the situation?

**S:** Dynamic name badges, printed on demand.

**T:** Could be print on demand, instead of ahead of time

**A:** Build a "print server" that was smart enough to print from a service bus message, that was sent from a mobile phone. We scanned a QRCode, the mobile device sent a message to the printer service, and under 1 second later, started printing a customer name badge.

**S:** Double sided name badges, with the schedule on the back

### 3. What measures have you personally put in place to ensure performance improvement targets and standards are achieved?

*Learn TV was brand new, and we needed a way to track performance on video watch time.*

**S:** Performance has to have a baseline. With the OKR's we use at Microsoft, first we need a foundation to start with, and if that does not exist, we need a baseline. Define the baseline metric to track for a specific period of time. In many cases we already have data.

**T:** My specific tracking area was "video watch time". Could we increase video watch time, and how?

**A:** With a baseline metric of prior periods watch time, we have a standard metric to set goals against. In the beginning, improvement metrics are usually pretty easy to achieve since this is a new battleground and almost everything could be improved. It's later rounds of improvements that often prove to be more difficult.

**R:** As we iterate time after time, we are able to show constant growth and improvement on video watch time. This comes in the effect of on screen content improvements, as well as on screen player enhancements.

### 4. Describe the most significant, continuous improvement project path you have led. What was the catalyst for this change and how did you go about it?

**S:** Non English content, over and over, and over. I have forever been involved with pushing more and more non-English content.

**T:** convince leadership it's important, help with automation around humans and machine translation.

**A:** 4 years ago I started pushing non-English content as an experiment in our live world wide events.

**R:** This last month, Microsoft Build delivered in 5 live translated languages being multicast live world wide. This was the accomplished by the work of many, but initiated by my grand experiments 4 years ago.

**R:** We have always had written documentation in many languages, but the video deliver in many languages is new.

### 5. Give me an example of a goal you've had where you wish you had done better. What was the goal and how could you have improved on it?

*Sprocket Project could have been bigger / faster*

**S:** I recently had too small of a goal to kick off a project. I did meet the project goals, but in hindsight they were too small.

**T:** With larger goals, I would have had a larger mindset to ask for funding earlier, to build out a more feature filled proof of concept.

**A:** This project is still a huge success, but hindsight tells me would could have had better execution, faster, and be even farther along that we are today.

**R:** In the future, I will thing bigger, earlier

### 6. Tell me about a time when you have worked to improve the quality of a product/service/solution that was already getting good customer feedback? Why did you think it needed continued improvement?

**S:** Name tags on demand - adding the "pop off" business cards, drink tickets, raffle tickets, hole punched coat check, and dynamic schedules all made an amazing print on demand system that much better.

### 7. Give an example where you refused to compromise your standards around quality/customer service, etc. Why did you feel so strongly about the situation? What were the consequences? The result?

*Janaina asked me this question and I didn't have an answer :(*

The one question I was not prepared for, so she skipped it and went onto another question which seemed fine, but I didn't have an answer here.

### 8. How do you seek out feedback on your team's performance? Give a specific example of how you used feedback you received on your team to drive improvement. (Manager)

**S:** I know the teams my direct reports are working with. I'll often ask for feedback from external viewpoints looking in. What could be be doing better? What has our team helped your team accomplish? Could we document to the success or learnings from a specific team member?

**S:** I Also often encourage my team members to seek out feedback on their own.

**S:** Recently we built a show for Learn TV named "Learn Live". Based on the requested feedback from others, we realized the show was great, but it was too small.

**T:** How how we enable additional executions / recordings / delivery of this show around the world to Kanye audiences?

**A:** Stepping back from the single show execution, we were able to creat a blueprint for others to copy.

**R:** Now the show is being executed and recorded in many fashions around the Microsoft ecosystem, including live inside worldwide events like Microsoft Build.

### 9. Can you tell me about a time when a team member was not being as productive as you needed? What was the situation? What did you do? What was the result? (Manager)

**S:** COVID has forced everyone on my team to change into a new role. Like many, our jobs significantly changed. Every team member was thriving in our new reincarnated jobs, accept one.

**T:** This was not a good fit, so what could I do as a manager to take a previous high performer, who is no longer perfuming?

**A:** Identify a new team for a win/win that aligns to their passions.

**R:** I was able to switch them over to a new team, and trade for an open resource. This was a win/win/win

### 10. Describe the process you go through to set specific targets to improve critical areas of your work/team. Please refer to a specific example. (Manager)

**S:** We can always do better. The question is how, and how much? My process to this is to evaluate the baseline of where we are today, and then properly set future targets. Critical areas to me are areas for customers that stop them from performing their task. Critical areas also measure growth of overall consumption.
I recently implemented a new system to track live show content called a "run sheet" This system started with 0% completion on shows. 0% because it didn't exist, every show kept track of their own information (or complete just winged it). In the television business, people also call this is run book, or a show flow.

**T:** Can we get every show to 80% completion of their "run sheets"?

**A:** This was a very difficult task, because everyone already has an existing system, and needed to be convinced that a standard system of "run sheet". My goal was a setup a standard that everyone on every show, knows how to use, and read, to make it easier to communicate with directors, external guests, commercials, etc.

**R:** After 6 months of pushing, many teams agreed that this simple, low tech, excel spread sheet was a game changer for building a show.

**Learning:** Initially my goal was 100% complete for every show, but people need a little flexibility in their content. The last thing we want is for a script to be read, so the details in a run sheet dropped from 80% to 100%, which seemed to be the sweet spot for content delivery.

## Second Source of Questions

### 1. Tell me about a time you looked at a key process that was working well and questioned whether it was still the right one. What assumptions were you questioning and why? Did you end up making a change to the process?

### 2. Tell me about a time you had to make tradeoffs between quality and cost.
