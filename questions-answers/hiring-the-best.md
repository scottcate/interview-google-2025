## Interview Questions

**S:** This is one of my favorite leadership principles, always hire talent that will make the team better.

**T:** For me as an entrepreneur, I need to hire people better than me. Hire better, faster developers, with skill sets much deeper in technology. Hire graphics designers.

**A:** I have a lifelong relationship with two people that I hired and worked with over two decades. One programmer, and one graphics designer.

**R:** These have been two of my goto candidates for many years and together we created many success stories together. They are both also very entrepreneurial and have not following me into Microsoft.

**Learning:** Finding great talent is rare, but when you do, cultivate that relationship with respect!

### 3. Give me an example of a time you have provided feedback to develop and leverage the strengths of someone on your team. Were you able to positively impact the person's performance? What were your most effective methods?

I was able to take a persons project management skills, and launch her career growth from regional presenter to international rocket ship growth. Under my vision, this person was promoted from college graduate to principal in Microsoft in a six year period.

### 4. Tell me about your hiring process when you hire key positions such as direct reports. Where do you go for talent? What resources do you employee? What are the steps in the process? What traits do you seek that will tell you the candidate will be successful on the team apart from obvious hard skills? [Probe how they assess specific things in an interview such as integrity? Do they do reference checks? How do they use them.] (Manager)

I look for:
- Personal referrals
- Book authors
- Community leaders. Start to study a subject, who is teaching it?
- Thought leaders

Traits, I look for:
- Problem solving skills
- Soft skills around people communication
- Can this personal articulate a problem, and the solution?
- Can this person write and convert a story, timeline, results, in words

I try to get references, and then follow up with references. This is a tricky business because the reference check is often a volunteer and so I am extra delegate with their time, but I try to dig into the candidate as much as possible. Did the candidate help you solve any problems? I ask for specific stories about working with the candidate? Why did the candidate list you as a reference?

Define integrity about the candidate. I like to ask about times when the candidate was vulnerable and made a good decision, "even when no one was watching". Maybe they found/returned a Wallet, or something else of value, money? And returned it. These can be great stories.

### 5. Tell me about someone that you hired that you thought was better than you in a number of areas. How did you add value to that person? (Manager)

While everyone I hire is better than me at many tasks, I can always add career growth for that person. Many times this is through the council of many through mentorship. Different people learn in different ways, and it's not always from me. But I can enable new relationships that

### 6. Tell me about at time when you had a low performing individual on your team. How did you deliver feedback to this person? Did their performance improve or did they leave the organization? (Manager)

**S:** Recently I took on a "needs improvement" individual, who turned out to be a rockstar on my team. They had previously simply been in the wrong place.

**S:** I also recently had a low performer on my team, where I identified a new role for them in another organization where they are now thriving.

### 7. Give me an example of someone who was promoted one or two levels up in the organization - not because they were a star who would naturally rise, but due to your development/coaching efforts. (Manager)

**S:** I have promoted many individuals both as direct reports, as well as helping other managers promote their staff to principal levels.

**T:** Through mentorship, could I provide promotional guidance?

**A:** In one specific case, I was able to setup a 2 year timeline, with goals, communication plans, executive visibility, and high impact actionable items. This was documented well in advance, the individual executed and is now thriving with promotions. He specifically credits me personally for his career growth, even though he is the one who did all the execution, I was there in the early days as a mentor. This individual is not a direct report of mine.

**R:** This individual has presently been promoted even earlier than the projected timeline, based on the career project outline we put together.

**Learning:** I have a very high sense of satisfaction when planning a career for someone that follows through and the promotions come to fruition.
