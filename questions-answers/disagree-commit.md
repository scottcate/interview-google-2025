# Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

- Question rigorously, challenge assumptions and escalate issues up and across the "food chain" when you're not satisfied, even if unpopular?
- Stand up for what you believe is in the best interest of the company and our customers?
- Openly demonstrate your support and commitment to decisions that have been made, even though you may not have originally agreed? Refrain from being transparent with these types of decisions in the best interests of your employees?
- Get on board with decisions that have been made, even though you may not have originally agreed?

## Interview Questions

### 1. Tell me about a time that you strongly disagreed with your manager on something you deemed to be very important to the business. What was it about and how did you handle it?

**S:** I like to fight for the right way, which is not always my way. I start with my initial opinions, but I'm not afraid to change my mind after listening to others.

**T:** Recently, I created a new service inside Microsoft and I simplified the usage of this service to a command line application, which is a little too nerdy for some users. I wanted to build a web front end, making the process easier, when I received emphatically pushback from my manager. This web site would take too much time, would derail the project, and would halt progress in other important time consuming parts of the project.

**A:** After listening to my manager, while I still disagreed, I pushed the good idea of a website to the next year. This was hard for me to do, since I thought the adoption would be stifled by a command line application, without a user interface.

**R:** Hindsight is 20/20 :) My Manager was absolutely correct. Building a website would have very much stifled the project, and maybe even brought the project to failure. Instead, I was able to use this time to make the project much more valuable with it's capabilities. During this time I also created ample documentation to help others use the nerdy parts of the command line. Installation was easy, and once people started using the solution, they loved it.

**Learning:** Others have experience that often helps to hear. I still have a roadmap for a web application, but in this case I was able to do more with less. I was still able to prove adoption, even with the project being a little harder to use as a command line application.

### 2. Give me an example of when you took an unpopular stance in a meeting with peers and your leader and you were the outlier. What was it and why did you feel strongly about it, and what did you do?

**S:** I recently was a stand alone voice supporting customers with non-English content.

**T:** Our team produces content in English, and we try our hardest every step of the way to convert this content into the multiple languages of our customers. Several team members argued that our localized "closed captions" were "good enough" for non English customers, where I stood out saying this is a very difficult, expensive and time consuming project, we have to do better. How can we provide local language presenters, delivering a localized presentation?

**A:** The truth is, we can't. Not for everything. BUT when we have a world wide audience, listening to an executive keynote, we hav the capability to deliver a native local language audio track.

**R:** I was able to convince leadership in this investment, and later proved a 230% growth in non-English viewing.

**Learning:** Put yourself in the customer shoes. Imagine traveling to a country where you don't speak the language, and then being tasked to learn something new in that language. Feels impossible, yet, this is what we were asking our customers to do.

### 3. When did you decide to go along with the group decision even if you disagree? Give me an example of a time you chose to acquiesce to the group even when you disagreed. Would you make the same decision?

**S:** I was initially for by leadership to create a batch of 40 sessions for an event. Later, this number increase to 60 sessions.

**T:** Because this was a leadership decision, I strongly disagreed, but I was convinced this was important.

**A:** We did create the content, but also, it was not a good idea. While we were able to product, we could only fulfill an audience from a fixed group of people inside the event. This meant if there were 1000 people, we now needed to over task our content team to create much more content, and fully support 60 sessions but delivered to the same 1000 people. This was NDA content so it could not be reused.

**R:** It's my opinion, we would have achieved greater satisfaction with the original 40 sessions. They would have had more time to mature, and would have been a stronger delivery than the 50% more sessions. This took so many more hours and resources to deliver, including extra travel budget for presenters to be onsite to deliver the content.

**Learning:** Do more with less, and pushing back on leadership is a fine line. They have their own reasons for the decisions they make. This is a tricky balance of corse correction back to an executive order.

### 4. Describe a time where you felt really strongly about something but ultimately lost the argument. How hard did you press the issue? What was your approach after you lost the argument?

**S:** I recently had received budget to use a vendor to build out a project, but soon after I hired the vendor, my skip level manager told me I could no longer work with that vendor. But I was unable to get a valid enough answer (to me?) to justify this.

**T:** I was now left to quickly find another capable vendor (Of my choice, just not the current vendor), to stay on track.

**A:** I was able to find another vendor, but this came at the expense of 4 weeks delay.

**R:** As of today, the project is back on track, but this was a major disruption. And I'm still not sure why the vendor could not be used, but I accepted the difficulty task and adjusted.

**Learning:** I'm still not sure what happened, but I chalk it this up to something unknown to me that was important enough for my manager to ask me to change directions.

*Talked about this with Ross: Can also talk about fixing the broken links in our billing emails.*

**S:** Our billing invoices would go out, and several of the links were broken because the `<a href="">` tag included a period appended to the URL.

**T:** How can I find this team, the right member, and the right solution?

**A:** After many days of digging (not full time, but spelunking around the global address book, and friends of friends) I found the right team in charge of sending email. This is a huge team, and a huge system sending many millions of emails. Everything was processed from a templating system. To my surprise, it was difficult to find someone who cared about this problem, even though it was creating a terrible user experience.

**R:** I was able to find the repository of email templates, and had identified a regular expression that was misplacing a period inside the href="" attribute, in addition to end the sentence. So basically, any sentence that need with a URL, would render with a broken URL as the period was malforming the URL. I was able to submit a fix for this, and single handedly removed over 1 million email invoice bad links.

**Learning:** This was way outside my scope of my job, but I could not let this go until it was fixed. The process end to end took me seven weeks (maybe 20-25 hours total), but to this day, the email links are accurate :)

### 5. Give an example when you submitted a good idea to your manager and s/he did not take action on it? How did you handle it? What was the end outcome?

*I don't have an answer to this one.*

### 6. Tell me about a time the business something because you persisted for a length of time. Why were you so determined? How did it turn out?

**S:** I have been trying to automated voice translation from English to Many other languages for several years now.

**T:** If we can automatically translate from English, we can open up a whole new world of opportunity for content that is currently too expensive and time consuming to deliver in the many languages of the world.

**A:** Recently, I was able to show a proof of concept that was finally "good enough". Good enough is presenting to the user that this is auto translated, and may not be perfect. Internal user feedback shows my process produces content that is "good enough" to help a non English speaking user understand the content, which was a very proud moment for me.

**R:** I am now able to start delivering auto translated content to internal test markets.

### 7. Provide an example of a time when you have had to make a difficult decision under pressure and then defend and justify it. Was it the right decision?

**S:** I was Set to deliver an in person, two-day training with 250 paid customers. This was a very important and profitable training session both for me, and the company. At 6:30am I found out the facility we rented had a legit bomb threat, and the FBI with bomb stiffing dogs were canvassing the property.

**T:** What do I do?

**A:** I decided to cancel the training, 90 minutes for it was set to start. I left the hotel/convention center without any of my luggage or computers. I would come back to it. I sent a blind cc email to every customer with a last minute 911: Training Cancelled message, explaining to them the delicate situation.

**R:** There was no bomb threat, and several people were very upset we had to refund a huge amount of customer revenue. Having the same situation, I would repeat this temporary loss, in the name of safety every time.

**Learning:** Yes, in my mind, this was the right decision.

### 8. Tell me about a time when you pushed back against a decision that negatively impacted your team. What was the issue and how did it turn out? (Manager)

**S:** I have a team of very well rounded rock star engineers. I overly promote their excellence, and I help manage their career growth. I was recently asked for two team members to take on a project that would be outside their scope of excellence, and I felt was just not a good fit.

**T:** How could I decline this opportunity and protect my engineers, both for them personally, as well as the existing workloads they were already prepared for?

**A:** I offered to work with my leadership, and find alternative people that were a better fit for this project.

**R:** This has such a great ending. I was able to find a team that not only shared the same interests, but had already solved the problem being asked of my team. The solution was already there, it was just unknown to us. So in the end, the task was completed, even before I declined the work from my own team. We just had to find it.

**Learning:** Since then I have questioned all new work, even when it is a good fit. Is it possible someone else has already done this? Could we take a little research time and ask around and check if a solution already exists? In some cases, the solution is so unique, you just know no one else has worked on it. But it's always worth taking a step back to ask and thing about questions that may have been already solved.
