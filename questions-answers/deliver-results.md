Interview Questions
1	Tell me about a time you (and your team if Manager) were driving toward a goal and were more than halfway to the objective when you realized it may not be the best or right goal or may have unintended consequences. What was the situation and what did you do? [ Testing for achieving the right result versus driving goal for sake of goal achievement. May want follow up questions regarding to determine if the person was willing to take a hit on goal attainment to achieve the right result and test long term versus short term thinking. ]
S: I am never afraid to go a backwards after finding a better way. This defines evolution to create a greater tomorrow based on learnings from today. This happens not only with lego building and ikea furniture, but also with projects. Rarely do we get to a 50% mark and then find out a large issue didn’t work, but I did have a project a couple years ago where the storage mechanism we were using for data was not accurate.
T: First I stepped back to identify the core issue, which was how some of our data was being over written.
A: After validating the inputs of our data were accurate and could be rebuilt with a replay mechanism, I confirmed that the data storage writes were outside the timing of our control, and needed to be replaced.
R: After a longer than expected 3 weeks, we were able to fully remove the original data storage and replace it completely. This was a setback, but one so important the entire future of this project relying on it’s success.
Learning: Some problems will only expose themselves with experience. Do not get so attached to a solution that it continues to drag you down further without being able to subjectively look at alternatives. Fight for the right way. Not my way, or the current way.
1	Tell me about a goal that you set that took a long time to achieve or that you are still working towards. How do you keep focused on the goal given the other priorities you have?
a	Goals are important to set in every facet of life. They help determine the priority of what to work on, and when. Goals are timed, some are short term goals with days or weeks, while others can be months or years. This is where vision comes in to see long term results.
S: “Long time “ here is subjective, so I’ll use a period of one year for a goal, that I am coming up on achieving. The current Video automation system I have built for Microsoft started with a vision from May 2021. Our team was producing hours and hours of video on a daily basis and the post production editing time was expensive, time consuming, and locked by the video editors we had to hire to help us.
T: What could be done to lower the workload from our team, decrease the need for subject matter experts in the video editing field, and produce reliable+repeatable results?
A: I defined an outline that included giving away my existing team, and moving back to an individual contributor role. I prototyped (in writing) an idea that built a new workflow engine where individuals could submit their own code to process video, in harmony with others that have submitted their own code.
R: What I have created is a video pipeline that very much resembles GitHub Actions, Microsoft Pipelines, or Octopus CICD. My build system is unique that it highly focuses on Video, Audio, and supporting assets for video on demand.
Learning: long term goals need vision to see them, sales to build a champion and leadership support, and execution to bring them to fruition.
1	Tell me about time where you not only met a goal but considerably exceeded expectations. How were you able to do it? What challenges did you have to overcome?
S: I recently post produced 650videos in 11 languages (7,150) in less than 48 hours. Previously this work was done by a vendor of 22 people working 24x7, and I fully replaced that vendor with automation.
T: What could I define as a workflow to be automated and remove human interruption?
A: After defining the process, that could be fully replaced by commands, define how these commands could be executed. Some video needs trimming, so we need a video split command. Every video needs a new closed captioning file, in the 11 languages. And every video needs supporting images (thumbnails in varying sizes)
R: All of these tasks are fully automated, but still require minor human guidance.
Learning: I heavily, by leaps and bounds, exceeded the automation that leadership thought was available to this service, and the system is continuing to grow with greater adoption.
1	Give me an example of a time when you were able to deliver an important project under a tight deadline. What sacrifices did you have to make to meet the deadline? How did they impact the final deliverables?
S: in 2018 after a year of kicking off Cloud Advocacy inside Microsoft, Scott Guthrie asked me to build a day long demo of al things “Azure getting Started”. This would become known as the “Red Shirt tour” and would be a string of events around the globe, repeating the same content day after day. We had a month to build the content.
T: Could this be built in a month?
A: Define the content priorities, define the time constraints of a days schedule, define the storyline so demos harmoniously continue from one to another. With a schedule and the storyline, we now need to find teams with vested interest to build executive level demos, and teach our leader the demo in a very deep technical sense.
R: Not only did we build amazing content, but we were able to launch from the Red Shirt Tour to another Tour around the globe and continue refining the content from Europe to Australia.
Tell me about a time you had significant, unanticipated obstacles to overcome in achieving a key goal. How were you eventually successful?
S: COVID might be my greatest management challenge.
T: I built a traveling team delivering in person content around the world. We were literally in airports day to day. I was in 36 countries in 2019
A: Transition to Scalable Written Content and delivery personal presentations via Learn TV.
R: We were able to reach fewer people with live content, but we were able to reach more than 10x larger audience with video on demand.
S: I remember once when my lead graphics designer, who was critical to my project success at the time, was moving out of state and would not be able to complete the work.
T: How could I find a replacement
A: It turns out I thought this was a major setback, when in the end, it was a great learning moment for me. After the employee left, I learned from many other employees the shortcomings on this designer. This was not the great employee I thought they were. I was able to hire a new designer, and almost instantly delivery faster and better results.
R: I had been in my comfort zone accepting the current deliverables and our teams capabilities.
LEARN: Since then, I have always instituted a confidential reporting system where people can report to me or HR their unhappiness of other co workers.
1	How do you ensure you are focusing on the right deliverables when you have several competing priorities? Tell me about a time when you did not effectively manage your projects and something fell through the cracks. (Manager)
a	Being a manager requires the art of delegation. Delegation can only be successful when the final vision and clear expectations are set.
S: I have recently been running a project where I specifically setup different vendors to work together on the same project. I find that vendors have to document to each other, so this is a great way to get documentation started early. Single vendors talks amongst them selves, where multiple vendors write to each other. I recently tasked a vendor to build something very specific, and they happily and quickly brought me a solution.
T: To my surprise, their solution was not what I asked for. It was completely different. This is my fault for not properly setting expectations. While I verbally supplied a description, and even wrote a scenario request, this was misinterpreted.
A: What my scenario request was missing is what I call a results sample.
R: After quick course correction, the vendor was able to deliver, and I now include a much deeper end to end scenario fully defining inputs and outputs. This is a catch 22, because in some cases I want to freedom and expertise of others to help define the inputs/outputs so it just takes more time.
1	What's your secret to success in setting stretch goals for your team that are challenging, yet achievable? Tell me about a time you didn't hit the right balance. How did you adjust? (Manager)
S: Stretch goals can be for a project or a person. It’s best when these are passion projects and win/win between the project and the team member.
T: What are the passions and strengths of the team member?
A: Find a common thread from the passions, and push that boundary. This could be learning something new, not because they have to, but because they want to. Stretch goals should also be concrete goals, not abstract. Something defined as a success. This could be a date, or a specific delivery. Goals need a full time babysitter to stay on track, if neglected, the goals will be procrastinated and not fulfilled. A good manager will encourage and remind the stretch goals, and why they have priority. Lastly, stretch goals need to be celebrated. I’m a huge fan of celebrating success.
1	Give an example of a mission or goal you didn't think was achievable. What was it and how did you help your team try to achieve it. Were you successful in the end? (Manager)
S: Visual Studio NYC Launch Event - I once accepted payment for a customer that was so big, no one on my team thought we could deliver. This was a company defining moment where we banded together and created something brilliant. The money was so good, but we had to fight to get it done.
T: We were able to build an entire event launch site in 3 days. While building the site, we were also able to build 800 Windows 8 Laptops, customized to each attendee and have them shipped from a warehouse in AZ to NYC.
A: This might be the craziest 3 days of my entire career.
R: We delivered 100%, and were even paid extra by the client for doing such a great job.
