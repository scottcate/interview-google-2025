# Experience and Leadership

## Experience engaging with tech community
- **Founding Member of the Cloud Advocacy Team**
    - Built out .NET Team
- **Built out content plan for Red Shirt Tour** - Scott Guthrie International event
- **Build 3 years of content for Ignite and Ignite Tour, world wide.**
    - 100 sessions, 50 each across two days
    - 10 learning paths per day, each with 5 sessions

## Your experience collaborating/orchestrating with other parts of business (product teams, marketing) to share best practices, etc
- Currently building a cross Microsoft solution for automation that touches over a dozen teams
- All my current "world wide" events, regularly touch dozens of teams where I (try to) choreograph the technical depth of the content.
- I am often the go between service from 2 external teams. They'll interface with me as input, we message and validate, then hand off as output

## Leadership Principle 6: Hire and develop the Best: Raise the bar
### Example 1
- **S(ituation)** - I had been in my role for 18 months and was looking for a change. Identifying a new group of expert individuals, I created a new team with a new focus on what we called "Scalable Content"
- **Task**: Graduate current team: I wanted to promote my existing team of leaders, to lead themselves, and did in fact promote one of my team members into leadership.
- **A(ction)**: Build a new team structure with leadership approval
- **R(esult)**: Ended up with a much better team, that was extremely happy and productive together.
    - Inventing and creating this new "Scalable Content" team - was a great leadership move. Give away one team to build another dream team.
    - Many teams continue to build content with Scalable Content formulas in mind.
- **Learning** - identifying an opportunity and if it's right, leadership will buy in.
    - Do not settle for what we have today, as good enough for tomorrow.

### Example 2
- **S** - 1st hire round into a team of 5 that would become 200+ We had a lot of recruiting and finding.
- **T** - hire the second round of leaders, that would in turn bring in their own A-Class teams
- **A** - Define the type of role that would sell itself and attract top industry talent
- **R** - Quickly hired up a team of 40 international community leaders, that in turn brought in their communities.
    - This was for the role, not for the money, often we ended up paying people less to join
- **Learning** - Money isn't everything, the right role is important to the right person

## Leadership Principle 10: Frugality: Creative problem solving; Do more with less
- Define priorities, what can we stop doing to make time for something more important
- Say no to not bring in new distractions. This is easier if there are guiding principles on the project.
- Start an early audit - people love to audit, make them the expert and get their feedback early and often.
    - This is a huge time saver to avoid traps with extra expert set of eyes/opinions
- Avoid scope creep in the name of "Bias to Action" and get something tiny done. Learn from that and move forward.
- Salesmanship/Recruiting to get more people involved
    - Especially with content development, more people solve problems and create content faster

## Leadership Principle 8: Think Big: saw an opportunity to do something much larger than the initial focus
### Example 1
- **S(ituation)** - Automating video, in my current role we are very heavily video based. Constantly cutting, editing, trimming, adding video together.
- **T(ask)** - can I automate this? Can I help others automate these time consuming, but could be menial tasks
- **A(ction)** - invent a new process, get my leadership buy in to give away my current team of 8, and focus on automation
- **R(esult)** - Microsoft now saves 1000's of human hours monthly with my invented automation. It's used across 6 organizations, and is built with future growth in mind to continue to invent and solve even more problems.
- **LEARNING**: always be inventing, automating, and optimizing. There is always a better tomorrow with speed and efficiency from what we did yesterday.

### Example 2: changed a teams direction, embrace a new way of thinking
- **S** - Covid stopped my team from world wide travel. 36 countries in 5 months.
    - One day - teams spread across the world.
    - Within a week, we had a stay at home workforce.
- **T** - Pivot to online video delivery
- **A** - Define a process and get buy in to deliver to an online audience, where in person is no longer available.
- **R** - Current online events and audience are usually smaller when live, but have a longer lasting tail that brings in a much larger audience.
- **LEARNING** - we could do so much more than content delivery. In person, or live. Following the user journey after content is delivered is a huge advancement I would like to dive into

## Leadership Principle 14: Deliver Results: with significant obstacles to overcome
- **S(ituation)** - building event content with 40 sessions, and a top down exec decision was made to increase the content to 60 sessions, with very little time.
- **T(ask)** - define a content plan, and then find content experts, capable of creating content and train the trainer material
- **A(ction)** - properly set expectations of why, what, and the deadlines
- **R(esult)** - we did achieve the added 20 sessions, but at the same time we over extended people to make this deadline.
- **LEARNING**: I knew to get exec buy and sign-off much earlier in the process to avoid this from happening again.

## Management Philosophy
- Hire better, enable staff.
- Best outcome is to promote and reward.
- Encourage a write it down program. Writing is such a deep thought experiment. And getting crisp and concise is hard. It can only come with iteration.

## How I grow/nurture my team
- Constantly promoted my team members
- Setup mentoring programs with sr staff outside my team
- Setup and encouraged constant time away, vacation days, health days
- Setup skip level, and double skip level meetings semi annually
- Encouraged regular feedback from others, both give and take
