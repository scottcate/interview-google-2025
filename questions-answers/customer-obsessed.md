Interview Questions
1	Give me an example of a time you used customer feedback to drive improvement or innovation. What was the situation and what action did you take?
S: After talking to customers I learned that explaining how a product works is less interesting. In the early stages of motivating a customer to use a project, they want to know what problems are being solved.
T: Convert o project demos into customer stories
A: This forever changed the way I build content, as well as push others to build content for a better customer connection
R: Why does a product exist? What problems does it solve? Relatable story tell will help marry a customer to a product.
1	Give me an example of your most difficult customer interaction and how you worked through it. What did you do? How did you manage the customer? What was her/his reaction? What was the outcome?
S: The first thing I ask about a difficult customer is root cause. Is the customer highlighting something that is a defect in our product that is in turn affecting many customers? Or is this a one off situation for the customer. Both of these have different directions and outcomes.  The first thing the customer wants to hear about is that I care about the problem. This is not done by saying “I care”, instead it’s done by asking questions and clarifications to understand the problem. once the problem is understood a commitment to the customer with timing and ongoing communication are key to managing a dissatisfied customer. Mysteries are hard to solve and in most cases take time to find a result. Clear and constant communications will help the customer feel that their problem is a priority.
T: I had a customer recently that was irate about not being able to get access to data they thought they had access to.
A: identify with the customer a caring solution, and ask questions to fully understand the problem. Take this information and research the back end .
R: Like many solutions, this resulted in an access control issue where the customer was logging in with a second account. These two accounts had shared access to many but not all resources.
1	Tell me about a time a customer wanted something, but you felt they needed something else. How did you approach the situation, what were your actions and what was the end result?
S: Often, customer don’t know how to solve the problem. They just know they have a problem. A customer once asked me to help staff a coat check at an event. This was a huge issue in the past, because the guests are very VIP, and the coat check is a time consuming problem. My solution for them was on-demand name tag printing. When the event name badge/credentials were printed, we could at the same time, print a coat check credentials.
T: Identify the customer root problem. In this case it was identity of the coat check items.
A: With a credentials being printed, the customer didn’t need “take a number” style coat check, they already have an identity card to give.
R: This resulted in a very quick item recover from alphabetical sorting, the customer never had to worry about “loosing a ticket”, and because the coat checks al had names on them, other parties could collect items in advance.
Learning: This solution was so popular, we need up with much more business in the events world, all because we could automate a coat check process. This later evolved into raffle tickets, drink tickets, and even dynamically printed schedules on the back side of name badges.
1	Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond the call of duty for a customer. Why did you take the action you did? What was the outcome?
S: When we were producing in person events, I was the customer escalation manager. Anytime something went wrong, it was brought to me for resolution. Mostly these were code of conduct violations, and after hearing the infraction I would decide if a customer was to be removed from the event.
T: first, understand the scenario from both sides.
A: Protect other customers. My position was to create a safe environment, and several times this was done by evicting an attendee. The “extra mile” for me was always paying close attention to any and all victims of the code of conduct violation. This could result in something simple like a moved seat, a paid lunch, or even a simple follow up to let the customer know we were still thinking about their safety.
1	Most of us at one time or another have felt frustrated or impatient when dealing with customers. Can you tell us about a time when you felt this way and how you dealt with it? When do you think it's appropriate to push back and say no to an unreasonable customer request?
S: Customers are selfish, and they should be. They are paying money for a service, and they expect results. When a customer is demanding customized services, is where I draw the line and am unable to assist the customer.
T: Is there a miscommunication or misrepresentation of the product or service that is making this customer believe it should do something it’s not?
A: Many times there is gold in a customer complaint that is deeper than the surface of the complaint.
R: Even when a customer can not be satisfied, there is a learning moment available that may help avoid future problems. Particularly if the same problem repeats itself.
1	Can you give me an example of when you've been able to see around the corner to meet a customer need or provide a customer with a solution or product they didn't yet know they needed/wanted?
S: Many times in technology, problems can be solved more than one way.
T: Working with hands on customers, I would often enlighten customers to a new way of solving their problems with a product they did not know about
A: Azure Pipelines and GitHub actions are perfect examples of this. Customers are still often deploying software manually, where automation could really help. Security audits are another item where customers often don’t know they are being informed of mistakes.
R: what a great sense of satisfaction it is to get feedback from a customer, thank you for for enlightening them about a product. That win/win is great when it happens.
1	To try and meet the high expectations of our customers, we sometimes promise more than we can deliver. Tell me about a time when you overcommitted yourself or your company. How did you resolve the issue?
S: Honesty, and frequent communication are the answers here. I overcommitted my deliveries on a project and almost instantly realized that I would not be able to delivery them on time. I promised a set of features within a certain sprint and then in sprint planning realized my promises were simply not possible.
T: Instead of not delivering, I just went back to the stakeholders and amended my promise and deliveries.
A: I explained my original intention with the information I had at the time, and what I’ve since learned that has changed my expected time frame and delivery results.
R: Because this was well ahead of time, and not last minute, I was able to reduce the friction of the unknown and deliver a smaller solution, and with more time the final solution.
1	Tell me about a time when you had to balance the needs of the customer vs. the needs of the business. How did you manage this situation?
S: As an entrepreneur, the paying customer deserves what they are paying for. If we accepted money from a customer, even at the demise of profit, we need to deliver what we promised. But if the customer was asking for something more than they paid for, then it’s important to properly set boundaries and expectations of what’s included and what’s not.
T: When a customer pays for a service, is the service boundary properly defined, and even includes a definition of what’s not included?
A: It’s a hard conversation to tell a customer what they are asking for is not included.
R: in some cases, if the ask is small enough, above and beyond service will still deliver this, but also include communication to the customer a VIP experience that shows the customer they are getting more than they paid for , or signed up for.
Learning: customer frustration almost always comes from a misunderstanding of what the product is executing. This CAN NOT be due to a misrepresentation of the product, that is a company fail.
1	In your opinion, what is the most effective way to evaluate the quality of your product or service to your internal or external customer? Give an example of a time when you used these measures to make a decision.
S: Honest user feedback is the best feedback. In my opinion this can best be collected from complaints, and user testing. Complaints are always a great source of information. Is the product not working? Are expectations of the product incorrect where the customer is expecting the product to do something it wasn’t promised.
T: Screen recording of a user test, is the best form of new user data.
A: Setup a time with a customer and inform them ahead of time about the recording, and the task you are going to ask them to do.
R: The first task should always be a throw away task, to settle nerves, and to get a feel for what they are looking at. The second task should be a new, unrelated task to the first. An the third task should be a slight derivative of the second. This will show a learned behavior. If the system is easy enough to use, task three should take much less time.
Learning: User testing is one of my favorite ways to collect data.
1	What changes have you implemented in your current department to meet the needs of your customers. What has been the result? (Manager)
S: In my case, my “customer” are fellow employees, and my priority is helping them be more efficient via automation
T: listens to problems and identify automation scenarios.
A: Build a prototype automation, and ask for testing, if the automation does in fact offer more productivity.
R: Report on results, this is big task that is often overlooked. Once automation is in place, it’s easy to forget about the silent impact it continues to deliver.
 
Second Source Questions
1	Tell me about a time you put the customer first, regardless of what peers or higher management directed. What was the outcome? How did this impact day-to-day interaction with your peers and/or management?
2	Walk me through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.
S: Authentication has been an issue over the last couple decades with customers having many logins, and even migrations of logins. Hotmail was purchased by Microsoft, there are new Outlook accounts, and even recently with windows there are Microsoft Accounts. When a user has an authentication issue, this is a show stopper, and while it's rare, I'll always dig to the bottom of this issue to find a customer solution.
T: On three occasions I have had users with valid login's, not be able to perform the job they should have been able to perform. A: With internal contacts and debugging accessible only to employees, I have been able to find cross linked accounts and resolve/enable the customer solution. R: Without me taking the "this is not right and needs to be solved" approach, these customers would be forever blocked with these accounts, being forced to create even more accounts, ,causing even more confusion. L While it was difficult and time consuming, there is a great sense of satisfaction knowing these three customers no longer have issues beyond their control blocking them from the normal and valid workflows they are trying to accomplish.
1	When do you think it's ok to push back or say no to an unreasonable customer request?
S: When a customer is asking for something extremely unique, is a situation I may not spend time solving a request, labeling this as unreasonable. T: Maybe I need to better understand the underlying issues of the request. It's possible here the customer is asking for a specific solution, when in fact another solution is already commonplace, but unknown to the customer.  A: If the situation is truly unique to the customer, they may not be satisfied with my declining their option, but I need to spend time scaling solutions that work for many hundreds, and many thousands of customers. R: It's also work mentioning, if a situation truly is unique to a single customer, maybe they are in fact using the wrong product or solution altogether. Helping the customer find a better solution, even if the solution is not mine/ours, is still a better solution for the customer. L: Understand the underlying problems is truly key in these situations. A happy customer using another project is a better customer than a dissatisfied customer on your own product.
2	Tell me about a time you had to compromise in order to satisfy a customer.
