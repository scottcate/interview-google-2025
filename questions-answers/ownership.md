Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-
term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.
They never say "that's not my job."

Interview Questions
1	Tell me about a time when you failed at work?
S: I don’t like to fail, but we all fail. I have a life long saying, you can quote me on this, “ Being wrong is a learning experience, and those that never learn stay simple minded”. In my experience “being wrong” is often the cause of not properly setting expectations.
T: When I fail, I like to look back and figure our the root cause, where was the point of failure, or at least the initial point of failure. Sometimes failures cascade into larger issues. I was recently asked to document and lead a workflow, which in my mind was setup fantastically.
A: When the execution time came, I ended up by myself, instead of the additional team member being there to help me. They were just offline. I had failed to properly set the expectation and this individual did not know the time sensitivity of the Workstream. It had to be done at a very specific time because downstream teams were relying on deliveries for them to start their work.
R: I ended up doing the first 1/2 of the workload on my own, and only later when the second person showed up, were we able to catch up and deliver only slightly behind schedule by 2 hours. I had failed to overlooked this detail and properly set the timing expectations.
Learning: The tiny details are important, and need to be documented and reassured by all parties. It’s terrible when a tiny tiny detail is missed, that then becomes a critical detail that causes failure. I think about this a lot and have ensured never to repeats this mistake.
1	Tell me about a time when you took on something significant tousled your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?
S: I recently accepted an out of scope assignment from my manager, that I was sure was not in the right direction.
T: What was the win/win in this situation? What could I do to help the project succeed, as well as provide a positive outcome for me and my team?
A: I decided to document and automate the process, so that I could have human assistance and reproduce high quality results. This took a little bit longer in the beginning, but quickly paid dividends as additional team members were able to participate without my involvement, using my automation.
R: The project ended up processing over 7000 workloads, where initially we were looking for 650 workloads. This was possible and successful directly related to my forethought and automation.
1	Give me an example of a time when you didn't think you were going to meet the commitments you promised. How did you identify the risk and communicate it to stakeholders? What was the outcome?
S: I recently was in charge of delivering a video project for on-demand viewing after the event concluded.
T: Define the process, and execute in a very condenses 24 hours following the event.
A: While I was able to deliver this, I found a part of the customer experience I was not happy with, but this visual was owned by other team. Could I convince them to change in such a short period of time?
R: yes, I was able to convince them with a code sample, and proving the increased user experience
Learning: Ownership of a problem can be accomplished with the selling of an idea and the importance of that idea to other teams. This is now a heavily used feature across many teams inside Microsoft, creating a much better user experience for customers worldwide.
1	Tell me about a time you made a hard decision to sacrifice short term gain for al longer term goal.
2	Give me an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What's the situation and what actions did you take? What was the outcome?
S: I had a direct report that had just taken on a new role, and while exceeding at previous roles, was just not producing well.
T: What could I identify to help them in this new role?
A: I spent more time with them, I added another person to help with additional project management. This still did not work. We did not align on the project.
R: Instead of moving the employee to needs improvement, I looked around and was able to identify another role for this person. Working across management I was able to get them moved in less than 2 weeks, and they are now thriving in this new role.
Learning: Sometimes (especially with COVID) people just end up in the wrong place. This doesn’t make them a bad employee.
1	What steps do you take to ensure projects you complete get transitioned effectively to new owners?
S: Handing off a project is best with thorough documentation. And in a well run project, this documentation starts at the beginning of a project, and is not thrown together at the end.
T: Could we prepare the documentation early, and test it’s effectiveness?
A: Yes, we could always test our documentation by tasking one person fron the documentation of another team member. Without talking about it, solely reading the documentation.
R: This format builds mature documentation from the beginning, and makes a project much easier for hand off.
Learning: I’m always involved in mini projects that pop up for Customer Experience, or content creation. I know these projects are short lived, but could and should be repeated by others in the future. Why make them re-invent what I already created? This has proven helpful time and time again in my career handing off projects.
1	Give an example where you elected to re-engage on a project that you had already transitioned to someone else. What was the situation and why did you feel it was important to re-engage?
2	How do you ensure your team stays connected to the company vision and bigger picture?
a	Frequent Check Ins, and written responses.
3	Give an example of when you felt a team or individual goal was in conflict with the company vision. What did you do? (Manager)
S: This happens a lot and my best manager inner voice teaches people to decline external opportunities.
T: How do decline?
A: instead of instantly accepting an external request, ask for some time and get back with the request after checking with your manager or team members to validate the request. Get a second set of opinions, sometimes the initial reaction is changed.
1	Tell me about an initiative you undertook because you saw that it could benefit the whole company and your customers, but wasn't within any groups individual responsibility so nothing was being done. (Manager)
S: Sprocket - video automation workflow. This is a new system I have invented that takes a task that needs a subject matter expert, and automates that task, removing the need for human intervention. My first example here is trimming a video. When we record a video, often the video is not stopped in time. This requires a human video editor to open the video in a video editing software, find the end point, truncated eh video, and then render a result. Video transfer time back and forth is also an issue. I automated a video split solution, along with 39 other identified workflows that can stream from one to another.
