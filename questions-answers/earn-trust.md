Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body order smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Interview Questions
1	Describe a time when you significantly contributed to improving morale and productivity on your team. What were the underlying problems and their causes? How did you prevent them from negatively impacting the team in the future?
S: Ignite the Tour speaker manager.
T: I needed to cover 100 customer sessions in 36 countries over 5 months. Presenters were burnt out with having a heavier than normal travel schedule, and having to deliver talks that were prepared by others, instead of inventing their own talk. This was a very difficult time in 2019 the first year. 2020 double the amount of content and tour stops. 2021 was much better with the following changes.
A: I took over scheduling and assigned people the same talks, in city pairs that were closer together. I also enlisted a new role I named a Polymath presenter that could fill in for 20 sessions and staffed 5 of these super presenter role at every event.
R: The new schedule was much less time consuming, cut costs with more efficient travel, let people delivery the same talks repeatedly which continued to get better over time delivering a better customer experience.
1	What three things are you working on to improve your overall effectiveness?
S: Properly setting expectations
b	S: Thoroughly communicating updates and changes as soon as possible to stakeholders
c	S: Listen and ask detailed questions
d	S: I actively admit my mistakes, and am even excited about sharing them. To me, being wrong is a learning experience. And when wrong is identified, that is stopping any future work going down that wrong path.
2	Give an example of a tough or critical piece of feedback you received. What was it and what did you do about it?
S: I have recently been told that I interrupt to often. Not to any one person, just in general.
T: How and what can I do to respectfully get my point across?
A: I have read a new book titled "Brief" which has many tips for talking less and following up with additional questions.
R: I do not think I'm done learning here, but I am actively trying harder to not interrupt in conversations and wait until the appropriate time to interject my thoughts.
1	Give me an example of an idea you had that was strongly opposed. Why was there so much resistance? How did you handle the negative feedback?
S: in 2019 When I was forming a world tour, I wanted to hire and bring a dedicated team of presenters on tour with me. This idea was declined, and my "presenter bench" was to pull from our dedicated Cloud Advocates. I was very against this as the travel would thrash schedules, and be very disruptive. For a regular one time tour, tapping a speaker bench is fine, my scenario was very different. My tour was 100 developer sessions over two days, that repeated in 36 countries around the world.
T: I had to complete my tour with the presenters I had at my disposal, which I did, with over communicating and selling the fun of travel, but at the same time defining the commitment to deliver.
A:
R: in 2020 (and repeated again in 2021) I was able to build a dedicated presenter team, known as the Polymath presenters. These presenters acted as uber presenters that could deliver up to 20 sessions, where the normal presenter we asked to deliver only two sessions.
1	Give me an example of a significant professional failure. What led you to making the wrong decision? What did you learn from this situation?
S: I invented CloudDB.com - this was 2007 on the internet and I spent 4 years building what I thought was the great solution to database there was.
T:  How could I simplify, secure, and help the world store and retrieve their data?
A: What we built was exciting and amazing for it's time, though time would prove we were 5 years too early. We built community users, and stored open source data, and we had a healthy community of hobbyist. But not a single company paid us to store their data.
R: As a result, all my future businesses were "customer funded". To me, this means, there is no initial  investment unless it's a customer paying for a solution. As an entrepreneur trying to build a business, revenue is important.
1	Give an example of a time where you were not able to meet a commitment to a team member. What was the commitment and what prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it?
S: I was recently unable to deliver a commitment on time due to a team member being sick with COVID and taking an extended leave of absence. We did not have proper documentation to continue the project with our key person being away for so long.
T:  What could we reprioritize and deliver less of?
A: We were able to back fill some of the work with help from existing team members, and document what we created.
R: We missed a deadline, and in the end we were only able to help by communicating status updates. Only after the employee returned were we able to finish the project, which caused a six week delay.
Learning: Important projects when possible should have at least two people working on them. I'm a firm believer that accountability to each other will help drive bigger, faster, and more accurate results that a solo delivery agent. Two people also creates a backup plan when one person may be unavailable, or even leave the project.
1	Building trust can be difficult to achieve at times. Tell me how you have effectively built trusting working relationships with others on your team.
S: My trust is build on top of honesty, humility, and clarity. This includes being vulnerable about what I don't know.
T: When I accept a commitment, I'm also accepting the communication updates between now and the delivery of that commitment.
A: These updates allow me to act and inform others of changes, scope creep, gather feedback, and maybe even change the scope of the delivery to be larger or smaller, a well as the delivery date, based on stakeholder feedback.
R:  This results in trust from outsiders knowing that I am going to communicate each step of the way, and deliver results based on a clear set of expectations.
1	Describe a time when you needed the cooperation of a peer who was resistant. What did you do? What was the outcome?
S: I had a program I was running with 4 segments of content. Each of these segments were unique pieces of content, and dictated by the vision of the program, so these 4 pieces of content were not interchangeable.
T: I needed 4 virtual teams to come together and for each of them to deliver their segment to make up a whole show. 3 of these teams bought in with full participation, while 1 team who I could only influence via their manager all-but fully ignored the program. Team 4 didn't participate in content workback schedules, they didn't participate in live rehearsals, and they didn't meet any deadlines coming up to the event.
A: How could I get reliable live content delivery from a team so disconnected? I finally did get a content outline, and short of firing the team and delivering a show with 3 segments (which would have also been terrible) I asked them to prerecord their segment. To reduce the risk of this content team being live, I was able to "simu-live" play back their content.
R: While the overall show was a success, the audience was quickly able to pick up that this content was no where near as prepared and as authentic as the other segments.
Looking Back: that team did not want to participate, but was being forced to participate by their management. I was not able to get clarity or any priority on their team, so everything was a half baked effort.
1	Tell me about a piece of direct feedback you recently gave to a colleague. How did s/he respond? How do you like to receive feedback from others?
S: I have recently promoted the idea of thinking bigger, executing to build an army of others. T: Instead of building a solution for himself, build a blueprint for others to execute on. This would scale much farther and faster if he could build a repeatable process.
A: With much success, this happened, and with about the same amount of work, this coworker was able to create a worldwide solution being enhanced and copied by others.
S: I have recently given quality feedback to a coworker who is not on my team, to look for another role, or even another company altogether. This is not common feedback, and maybe even considered as "the easy way out"
T: my co worker confidently told my about their unhappiness and several new managers that have shifted into and out of the role as many as 4 new managers in a single year.
A: The co worker is still in the same role but is not happy, but has a personal sense of satisfaction of the product they are delivering.
1	Tell me about a time you had to communicate a big change in direction for which you anticipated people would have a lot of concerns. How did you handle questions and/or resistance? Were you able to get people comfortable with the change?
S: I recently moved myself into a new role as part of a larger reorganization. I previously had a team of 8 members that needed a new leader.
T: Reorgs can be great for the business, but extra hard on team members changing roles. Fortunately, I had previously setup my team as leaders, and one of them was able to become a manager of four team members, while the other three team members were being better allocated to the work they were doing on other team.
A: I communicated individually to the three team members that were going to be moving ahead of time, and in confidence. In all three cases, this was a win/win move for the individuals and while there were a lot of questions and concerns of "starting over" they were very appreciative of my 1:1 time with them. The existing five team members were happy to continue their existing role, but under a new leader who previously was their peer.
R: Communication and compassion are key to delivering big changes. Ask yourself how your would react if you were on the other side of the table, and then learn from your own answers about how you would like to be treated.
1	Tell me about a time your team's goals were out of a alignment with another team on which you relied to attain a key resource. How did you work with the other team? Were you able to achieve your goals? (Manager)
S: Running a live TV station creates a lot of last minute programming changes. New events are added, displacing existing programming has been our biggest challenge. When a large event in onboarded we often look for additional supporting presenters from our Cloud Advocacy org. Several of the PM teams like to work with a huge lead time. Trying to micromanage an annual calendar.
T: While the annual calendar is great to have such far sight, it's also a burden for making fluid changes in the short term. If a presenter is already committed, but the commitment is to a much less important priority.
A: I was able to gain the trust of the PM team by starting to communicate with them first, instead of previously going directly to the cloud advocates. This was an easy, but important step in the communication line.
R: As a results of this new trust, the PM team knew that I was only asking for high profile presentation time, and these presentations would be highly visible and have a much higher priority.
1	Tell me about a time you uncovered a significant problem in your team. What was it and how did you communicate it to your manager and to your peers or other stakeholders. (Manager)
S: I previously had a team member that would disappear for a few days, without warning, and without communication.
T: This team member was a super star 95% of the time, but would literally not show up for without any planned vacation or prior warnings. This would happen maybe 3 times a year.
A: After a two year period, I finally terminated the employee. This was extremely hard for me because there is never a good time to lose a high producing employee, but I could no longer accept the risk involved when deadlines and communications are such a high priority.
R: With a short term negative experience and reduced productivity, I was able to refill the position with someone much more dependable.
Learning: in hindsight I was being too nice, and should have ben stricter with demanding better communications and respect for the rest of the team and terminated this employee after the first few infractions.
Sometimes the hard thing and the right thing are the same.
