# Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

- Simplify and always encourage others to innovate and change inefficient or unnecessarily complex processes?
- Use new Ideas and methods to do your job better and enhance the customer experience?
- Create an environment that encourages breakthrough thinking that is simple?
- Encourage innovation and invention for the right reasons, helping others not to unnecessarily reinvent the wheel?
- Think up and implement great ideas and simple solutions?
- Know when not to reinvent the wheel?

## Interview Questions

### 1. Tell me about the most innovative thing you've done and why you thought it was innovative (can also probe with: that sounds more evolutionary than revolutionary. Tell me about something you've done you feel was truly revolutionary? Ask for one or two additional examples to see if it's a one-off or pattern.)

### 2. People often say the simplest solution is the best. Tell me about a particular complex problem you solved with a simple solution.

**S:** I love a non-technical solution. Recently I provided a very low tech solution to keep 6 different teams informed on status. We had 7000+ folders tracking video post production.

**T:** Each team has their own ticketing and information system fro the work they needed to do, but this isn't shared between teams.

**A:** I created a simple readme.txt file that traveled with the video assets between all 5 teams.

**R:** This very low tech solution was celebrated by many to keep track of what was needed from team to team.

### 3. Tell me about a time you were able to make something significantly simpler for customers. What drove you to implement this change?

**S:** Name Badges with "pop off" hole punched coat check for ticketing

**S:** Multi-Edit is a feature that was very qualitly to build, but is useful time and time again for users inside a product to be able to edit multiple lines with a single command.

**T:** Before this feature, edits had to be done one by one.

**A:** Define the common attributes between multiple selected items, and allow those elements to be edited in batch.

**R:** This was the single largest productivity boost of a product I recently built.

### 4. Describe a challenging problem or situation in which the usual approach was not going to work. Why were you unable to take the usual approach? What alternative approach did you take? Was it successful?

**S:** Instead of building a solution for a customer, I invited the customer to be a part of the internal process and actually built a solution with the customer. Originally my idea of "what if the customer sits with us as we build this" was rejected.

**T:** Convince leadership, and then the customer we could go faster together

**A:** Once we were approved, the customer was elated to join the project and build the solution along side us. This was a small project and in less than a week we completed the task.

**R:** The customer now knows how to fish, instead of just eat. We were able to move faster, and at the same time, educate the customer on how we built their solution, enabling them to build their own solutions in the future.

**Learning:** Bringing a customer in house to build a feature is a very novel idea, that worked great in this scenarios. Very outside the box thinking for this to happen.

### 5. Give an example of creative idea you had that proved really difficult to implement. What was the idea and what made it difficult to implement? Was it successful?

**S:** Building the myKB permissions check on a binary tree was a very difficult, but immensely successfully idea.

**T:** Talk about role based access control, and how the binary system is better than if/this/then checks

**A:** Define roll up security with aggregates

**R:** Much clean and reusable code. - this code was in fact also used on future projects to build and secure feature access, feature detection.

### 6. Tell me about an out-of-box idea you had or decision you made that had a big impact on your business.

**S:** See #5

### 7. Give me an example of how you have changed the direction or view of a specific function/department and helped them embrace a new way of thinking? Why was a change needed?

**S:** Scalable Content is a whole new ways of thinking about content. - this was the paper I wrote and submitted. Easy to reference back to that.

### 8. How do you draw new thinking and innovation out of your team? Give an example of how your approach led to a specific innovation. (Manager)

**S:** I like to have monthly brainstorming meetings on random topics. Can we talk through what's currently happening, and I that still a good approach.

**T:** What about this could be better?

**A:** Can we define actionable items that would save the user time? Are their steps being forced upon a user that could be removed to reduce friction.

**R:** We have often (over and over) used the signup forms for new services, and continued to enhance and simplify the workflow for new users, all while A/B/C split testing ideas to track changes, both positive and negative.

### 9. Tell me about a time when you have enabled your team or a team member to implement a significant change or improvement. (Manager)

**S:** Brilliance should flow from every member of the team. While I was reluctant to "build another site" my team did end up building a very valuable set of resources on SharePoint that acted as a self help system.

**T:** How could we use the tools we have today, and build an information center for our customers (other employees) to self service their own answers.

**A:** With Sharepoint the team was able to have as single/simple source of truth for customers, instead of scattered documents here and there.

**R:** This quick win was something I was not a fan of initially, until the team implemented it and was able to prove it's success of customer traffic.
