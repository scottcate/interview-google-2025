## **PROFESSIONAL WORK HISTORY**

### **Technical Founder** • OVAL SOFTWARE
**Feb 2024 – Current**

Invented new marketing software as a service <https://301.Pro> – Architected and deployed a high-performance multi-cloud software solution, deployed with a global reach across 350+ data centers, processing millions of transactions per second with guaranteed sub-250ms response times. Implemented a rigorous test-first development methodology to ensure exceptional accuracy and reliability, resulting in a highly resilient system operating at enterprise scale.

### **Head of Developer Program** • AMAZON AWS
**June 2022 – Feb 2024**

Recruited by AWS to invent a multi-national program to increase developer satisfaction through education, incentives, and recognition initiatives. My role focused on content teams prioritizing high-quality and a greater volume of content with less staff. I transitioned teams away from isolated projects, created new role-based checks and balances, and outsourced low-skill tasks to vendors. I created and implemented a new ***Content Operation Playbook*** offering a cohesive framework for efficiently creating, reusing, scaling, translating, maintaining, and decommissioning published content, all while mitigating bottlenecks and ensuring robust backup systems. This cross team, collaborative work led to the community offering <https://community.aws/> - the first content first property where customers are allowed to post third party content.

### **Principal Lead Cloud Advocate** • MICROSOFT
**2017 – June 2022**

Onboarded as initial staff to create a new organization known as Developer Cloud Advocacy. Over five years, I grew new teams and invented and implemented new processes. I have also been able to identify and manage my career growth, allowing my entrepreneurial spirit to continue even within a large enterprise.

- **2017:** Built a Cloud Advocacy team from inception. Hired leadership roles and created a new technology-based .NET Cloud Advocacy program. Within six months, our initial group of five had incredible success, expanding to 50 Cloud Advocates and Leads, spread across many technology stacks. Within one year, we had successfully onboarded over 120 Cloud Advocates with highly diverse backgrounds in technologies, personalities, and geographies.

- **2019:** I identified a new role, creating content with a blueprint of reusability to **Scale and Distribute learning content worldwide**. I was able to promote my existing team and migrate to an individual contributor (IC) role. In this IC role, I created and defined inside Microsoft what is now known as Scalable Content. Scalable Content has a life cycle that includes a maintenance plan and has much more customer impact than content as one-hit wonders.

- **2019:** My IC role was recognized with exceptional success and rewarded with top rewards and a promotion to Microsoft Level 66. This success allowed me to recruit eight internal team members to join me, and I officially led this new **Scalable Content** team. Our goal was to create scalable content and coach other teams on how to develop quality reusable content of their own. I invented an innovative program to generate content in **18 languages.** Over 1000 employees and field certified trainers presented this content to over **500,000** in-person event attendees, and millions of Microsoft customers online. Scalable Content builds a plan that treats content as an Open-Source project with documentation, a maintenance plan, a feedback loop, and security reviews. COVID transitioned this team from creating in-person presentation content to online video content. This allowed us to scale our content goals further and faster. I also recognized and enabled influential team members through many senior and principal promotions within this team.

- **2022** is the year of video automation. In late 2021, I identified precious human hours wasted on video workflows and workstreams. Tasks that require a subject matter expert to execute bring delays and bottlenecks to workflows. I identified over forty opportunities to automate and increase efficiencies in our video pipeline. With this entrepreneurial and frugal spirit to do more with less, I once again invented a new automation role and was approved to build a new project and team. I created a repeatable and **automated system to save thousands of human hours** and provide better customer content.
