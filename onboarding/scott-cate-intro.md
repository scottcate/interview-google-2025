Hi team!

I’m Scott Cate, and I’m thrilled to be starting this new chapter with all of you. My family and I just relocated to beautiful Boulder, Colorado where we will all be enjoying the outdoors. Over the years I’ve had the privilege of building global technical content, designing and delivering keynote presentations, and racking up passport stamps while training customers and partners around the world. I geek out on creating simple explanations for complex topics and love the energy that comes from a live audience—whether that’s in a conference hall or an internal workshop or a global stage. When I’m not working you’ll find tinkering with code on cloud based side projects.

I can’t wait to dive in and start collaborating with everyone. If you have a moment, please ping me on Chat and introduce yourself — I would really enjoy meeting you!
