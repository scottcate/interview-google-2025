# Google Cloud Training - Product Manager Role Overview

## Role Description
This Product Manager role focuses on defining and developing Google Cloud's training content portfolio. The position requires understanding customer needs across various stages of the sales cycle and determining appropriate content formats to meet those needs. The role serves as a Technical Account Manager (TAM) for content development, building out the portfolio of available training offerings ("what's on the truck").

## Current Training Portfolio
- **Cloud Spark**: 1-3 hour courses
- **Hackathons**: Experimental format being tested
- **Traditional Instructor-Led Training (ILT)**: Core offering
- **Advanced Solution Labs (ASL)**: 3-4 week intensive hands-on training
  - Led by specialized ASL trainers
  - Culminates in customer Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Business Model
- ILT is a profit center for Google Cloud
- Training is sold through:
  - Direct payment ("green dollars")
  - Training credits (often included in sales incentive packages)
- Current challenges include:
  - Unused training credits
  - Revenue not booked until training is delivered
  - Different needs across customer segments (Enterprise vs. SMB)

## Customer Segments
- **Enterprise Customers**: Require more customized approaches
- **Small-Medium Business (SMB)**: 
  - More scaled, on-demand learning with limited ILT
  - Targeted SMB campaigns like "Learn and Earn"
  - Focus on incentivizing customer admins to drive learning adoption

## Key Responsibilities
- Research market fit for training offerings
- Define the work: content types, pricing models
- Partner with teams to bring offerings to market
- Coordinate with content development teams (split between different organizations)
- Balance standard training (scalable) with custom needs (less scalable)
- Regular engagement with field teams and customers to refine the catalog
- Experiment with new content types and delivery methods

## Delivery Models & Partnerships
- Custom training specific to customers (limited scalability)
- Potential for consulting engagements for highly customized needs
- Augmentation with workshops involving:
  - Global System Integrators (GSI)
  - Professional Services Organization (PSO)
- Scaling through programs like:
  - Cloud Learning Leads (CLL)
  - Partner-Led Learning Journey (PLLJ)
  - Authorized Partners (e.g., Jellyfish, Netcom)

## Target Audience
Current focus is on selected enterprise customers, with consideration for regional differences (e.g., JPAC region has unique constraints).

## Strategic Vision
Finding the right balance between:
- Standardized, scalable training (approximately 90%)
- Customized, customer-specific content (approximately 10%)
- Exploring innovative content formats and delivery methods
